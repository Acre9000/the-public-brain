I am going to test some things in here

## I guess this would be a title

And what is a title without a subtitle?
Let's bring in some ideas:

Game making as research-practice ([[Games/Fairplay 5\|Fairplay 5]]). Radical reimagination of climate futures. Sustainable play. All these sound fantastic, particularly for a half unemployed, precarious game developer/artist wanting to find research venues for their game-making practice. 

Academia seems that it could be one of the places that could create a space for game-making that is not market-oriented. That it does not rely on profit as the main reason for how and what we make. But of course, many times Academia suffers from the same issues you might expect from the industry, just with a different flavour. Where does funding come from? Who do they respond to? What sort of return on investment they expect, and what will be their signifiers of success?

I find myself finding sexy PhD positions with super cool initial descriptions, that end up being about AI workflows. This should not be that much of a surprise, given the immense fortune that is being spent on anything AI related, and how eager industry leaders are to cut costs and automate, openly excited with all the promises of infinite productivity and the end of scarcity and bla bla bla.

I am though slightly concerned about how very serious issues like climate seem to just get slapped around some of these proposals that end up focusing on AI, wihtout seemingly addressing the contradictions that AI and climate bring to the table. Its just so nice to say and read "radical reimagination of climate futures". And maybe the worst is that I believe games do have great potential for offering platforms for WILD and RADICAL EXPERIMENTATION. 

But how? At what scale? When are games empowering radical/critical thought, when are they empowering action? When do they bring awareness to something we were not looking at before, and to what degree do they inspire actual change?

I think speculation is a popular spectrum within games concerned with change/justice, just because of how loose the term and its surroundings sound like. It doesn't ask for more than an imaginative proposal, and leaves all the responsibility to an audience that gets exposed to it to transfer that into reality. Maybe the simulation aspect of games can add a believable layer to this experience, helping the speculation actually feel more real.

But could this also be some sort of green washing, low effort escapism that gets rapidly forgotten in a reality that has no time to implement imaginative alternatives?
